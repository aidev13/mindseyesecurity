      <h2>Key Concepts of Access Control</h2>
      <h3>Authentication</h3>
      <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The process of verifying the identity of a user or system.</p>
      <p><strong>Methods:</strong> Passwords, biometrics, tokens, multi-factor authentication (MFA).</p>

      <h3>Authorization</h3>
      <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The process of determining whether a user or system has permission to access a resource.</p>
      <p><strong>Mechanisms:</strong> Role-based access control (RBAC), attribute-based access control (ABAC), discretionary access control (DAC), mandatory access control (MAC).</p>

      <h3>Audit and Monitoring</h3>
      <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The process of recording and analyzing user activities to detect unauthorized access or misuse.</p>
      <p><strong>Components:</strong> Logging, real-time monitoring, anomaly detection.</p>

      <h3>Accountability</h3>
      <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Ensuring that users are held responsible for their actions within the system.</p>
      <p><strong>Methods:</strong> Logging activities, assigning unique user IDs, enforcing policies.</p>

      <h2>Types of Access Control Models</h2>

      <h3>Discretionary Access Control (DAC)</h3>
      <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Access is granted based on the identity of the user and the discretion of the resource owner.</p>
      <p><strong>Features:</strong> Flexibility, ownership-based permissions.</p>
      <p><strong>Use Cases:</strong> Personal computers, small networks.</p>

      <h3>Mandatory Access Control (MAC)</h3>
      <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Access is based on fixed policies established by a central authority, often using security labels or classifications.</p>
      <p><strong>Features:</strong> High security, strict policy enforcement.</p>
      <p><strong>Use Cases:</strong> Military, government systems with classified information.</p>

      <h3>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)</h3>
      <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Access is granted based on the userâ€™s role within an organization.</p>
      <p><strong>Features:</strong> Simplifies management, aligns with organizational roles.</p>
      <p><strong>Use Cases:</strong> Enterprise systems, large organizations.</p>

      <h3>Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)</h3>
      <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Access is based on attributes of the user, resource, and environment.</p>
      <p><strong>Features:</strong> Dynamic, fine-grained control.</p>
      <p><strong>Use Cases:</strong> Complex environments, cloud services.</p>

      <h3>Rule-Based Access Control</h3>
      <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Access decisions are based on predefined rules, often in the context of a firewall or network security policy.</p>
      <p><strong>Features:</strong> Structured rules, typically used for network or system security policies.</p>
      <p><strong>Use Cases:</strong> Firewalls, network access control.</p>
