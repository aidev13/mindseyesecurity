      <h2>What is CCTV?</h2>
      <p>CCTV (Closed-Circuit Television) is a system of video cameras used for surveillance and security purposes. Unlike broadcast television, CCTV systems transmit signals to specific monitors and are not publicly distributed. CCTV is commonly used for monitoring and recording activities in various settings such as public spaces, private properties, and commercial establishments.</p>

      <h2>Key Components of a CCTV System</h2>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Cameras:</strong> Capture video footage. Types include analog, digital, IP, and PTZ (pan-tilt-zoom) cameras.</li>
          <li><strong>Monitors:</strong> Display live or recorded footage for viewing and analysis.</li>
          <li><strong>Recording Devices:</strong> Store video footage. Examples include DVRs (Digital Video Recorders) and NVRs (Network Video Recorders).</li>
          <li><strong>Cables and Connectors:</strong> Connect cameras to recording devices and monitors. Types include coaxial, Ethernet, and fiber-optic cables.</li>
          <li><strong>Network Equipment:</strong> Switches, routers, and other devices for networked CCTV systems, particularly for IP cameras.</li>
          <li><strong>Power Supply:</strong> Provides power to cameras and other components. Options include wired and PoE (Power over Ethernet).</li>
          <li><strong>Software:</strong> Manages and controls the CCTV system, including viewing, recording, and analyzing footage.</li>
      </ul>
  </div>

  <div>
      <h2>Types of CCTV Cameras</h2>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Analog Cameras:</strong> Use traditional video transmission methods and are typically connected to DVRs.</li>
          <li><strong>Digital Cameras:</strong> Capture higher resolution images and often connect to NVRs.</li>
          <li><strong>IP Cameras:</strong> Network cameras that transmit data over an IP network, allowing for higher resolution and remote access.</            <li><strong>Dome Cameras:</strong> Encased in a dome, often used for indoor surveillance and offer 360-degree coverage.</li>
          <li><strong>Bullet Cameras:</strong> Long, cylindrical cameras used for outdoor applications with a focus on specific areas.</li>
          <li><strong>PTZ Cameras:</strong> Cameras with pan, tilt, and zoom capabilities for dynamic and detailed surveillance.</li>
          <li><strong>Infrared Cameras:</strong> Capable of capturing video in low light or total darkness using infrared technology.</li>
          <li><strong>Thermal Cameras:</strong> Detect heat and can be used for surveillance in complete darkness or harsh conditions.</li>
      </ul>
